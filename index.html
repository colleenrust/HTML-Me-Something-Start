      <h2>dun dun duuuuun</h2>
      <article><p>Every year, my entire family goes on a trip to Wisconsin for the summer and stay in a small cabin together.
         There are four bedrooms in total so, my grandpa gets his own, my parents get one, my aunt katie and uncle nick get one, 
         and my aunt bridget and uncle scott get one. My uncle kelly and aunt heather sleep on a day-bed on our porch.
         All <b>thirteen</b> of my cousins sleep in the open basement full of twin sided beds and bunk beds. It is like having a giant 
         sleepover for an entire week with all my cousins, it was awesome.<p><article>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">One year the power went out in the dead of summer!</p>

               <main>
      <p>Due to how the plumbing was designed, the toilets were not able to refill with water so we had to run down
         68 stairs to the lake that the cabin is on to have water to flush the toilets. That was really good for my calves. None of our
         lights would work either because the electricity was out so we used antique oil lamps to light the room while we ate dinner at night.
         The oil was rather smelly but it was awesome to play card games in the light of an oil lamp.

      <p> I can't wait to go back hooray!</p>
